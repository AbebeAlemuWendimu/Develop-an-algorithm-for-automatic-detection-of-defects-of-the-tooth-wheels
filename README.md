# Develop-an-algorithm-for-automatic-detection-of-defects-of-the-tooth-wheels

Develop an algorithm for automatic detection of defects of the tooth wheels.  Directory  `images` stores a few images: `img_OK.png` with OK sample of the tooth wheel. Files `img_1_NOK.png` and `img_2_NOK.png` are images of a tooth wheel with different kind of defects. The typical defects are bad shape of the tooth or wrong diameter of the holes in the tooth wheel. The algorithm should check each tooth whether it has a proper size. The location and orientation of the tooth wheel in the image is random. Marker the found defects into the image with the thick red bounding box. To the corner of the image put number of the detected defets.
